# HTML Motion Graphics Overlay Sample

The scenario for this sample is inspired by a cloud-based live production workflow running in AWS that takes a live video source and applies a composition process to include a motion graphics overlay generated by an HTML source.

## Architecture
The sample demonstrates a practical use of the [AWS Cloud Digital Interface (CDI)](https://aws.amazon.com/media-services/resources/cdi/) where a composition process running in an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance overlays full motion graphics such as an animated logo or a scoreboard onto a live video source streamed from [AWS Elemental MediaConnect](https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/). The motion graphics are generated by rendering an externally provided HTML source.

Using CDI, the result is transmitted as uncompressed video through the network to a second EC2 instance where it is encoded and packaged as HLS segments, uploaded to an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket, and then streamed live to clients. As an alternative, the output can be sent directly to [AWS Elemental MediaLive](https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/) which also supports CDI input sources.

A brief description of each component is included below.

### Media Sources
The inputs of the composition process are a live video source and the HTML markup used to render the motion graphics overlay. 

As a video source, the sample uses a MediaConnect flow connected to a third EC2 instance reproducing a sample video file in a loop and streaming the output to MediaConnect using RTP. Of course, it can be replaced by any suitable live video source.

The overlay source can be any HTML content capable of rendering an animation. It is retrieved from an external web server or an S3 bucket using HTTP or read from a local file on disk. 

### Motion Graphics Renderer
The Motion Graphics Renderer is a process that uses an offscreen Chromium instance to render the externally provided HTML source. It captures changes to the rendered page and outputs them as a sequence of uncompressed video frames.

HTML can take many different forms, so several mechanisms are available to customize the way in which the graphics are rendered onto the live video.  

For example, the graphics renderer can change the size of the page, which is useful for adaptive layouts that behave differently depending on window size, or it can limit the capture to a specified region of the page for cases where there are additional elements that should not be included in the overlay. Finally, it can apply a scaling factor to control the overall size of the rendered elements.

Transparency effects can be applied as well. By default, the background is made transparent so that the live video shows behind any elements rendered directly on the page. A specific color can be designated as transparent instead (chroma key) to handle elements placed inside other containers and not directly onto the body. Lastly, the renderer can apply a given background color to the overlay and create opacity effects by changing its alpha component.

### Composer
The composition in this sample is handled by [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) running in the first EC2 instance and reading the RTP stream coming from MediaConnect. It decodes the incoming stream and then overlays the sequence of raw frames produced by the Motion Graphics Renderer.

The overlay position on the screen can easily be changed to accomodate different requirements.

![alt text](doc-assets/scoreboard-upper-left.png "Scoreboard upper left position")

The output from the composer is uncompressed video which then needs to be delivered to the second EC2 instance running the encoder.

### CDI Pipe
CDI must be used to transport the uncompressed video across the network with minimal latency. While most applications will typically add support for CDI natively, in this case we are using an existing application, FFmpeg, and integrating CDI. 

To enable this integration, the transmission is handled by another component that is essentially a protocol bridge between a local inter-process communication mechanism, in this case sockets, and CDI. This component can act as a transmitter, in which case it reads a video stream from a local socket and transmits it to a CDI destination, or it can behave as a receiver, reading a CDI stream and outputting the data it receives to a local socket where applications can connect to process the incoming stream.

The composer, or any socket capable application, can be connected to the CDI pipe to enable them to transmit or receive live video using CDI. 

### Encoder
Video stream encoding is performed by the second EC2 instance. This machine is also running another instance of the CDI Pipe component, this time configured in receiver mode. Once again, FFmpeg is used to connect to the componentâ€™s output socket to read the uncompressed video coming from the first machine, encode it, and then package the result as an HLS stream. 

As each HLS segment is encoded, it is uploaded to an S3 bucket that has been previously created and configured with a policy that enables public read access. Currently, this process involves mounting the S3 bucket as a virtual drive in the second EC2 instance using a third-party component (CloudBerry), although this may change in the future. The HLS segments are written directly to this drive as if it were a local disk.

While in this sample the composition output is sent directly to the encoding process running in a separate machine, other production workflows could involve additional intermediary processes where the video is transported for processing between two or more EC2 instances using CDI.

### Clients
Clients can use any HLS capable player to read the manifest from the S3 bucket and play back the composition output.

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Visual Studio (with the C# and C++ Development workloads installed)

- Follow the [AWS SDK build steps](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdi-sdk/blob/mainline/INSTALL_GUIDE_WINDOWS.md#download-and-build-the-aws-sdk-for-c) to download and build the **AWS SDK for C++**.
  > **Note:** When runnning the `msbuild` command to build the SDK, make sure to also include the `/p:Configuration` parameter specifying the selected configuration mode (Debug or Release). Example to build in Release mode:
  > ```
  > msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release
  > ```

- Follow the [AWS CDI SDK build steps](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdi-sdk/blob/mainline/INSTALL_GUIDE_WINDOWS.md#build-the-aws-cdi-sdk) to build the **AWS CDI SDK**.
    > **Note:** Before building the SDK, disable the display of performance metrics to your Amazon CloudWatch account. To do this, edit the `aws-cdi-sdk\src\cdi\configuration.h` file and comment out the following directives:
    > -  `#define CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_ENABLED`

## Known Issues
- Press CTRL+C to exit the transmitter and, depending on running options, also the receiver. Press 'q' to exit the player.
- In streaming mode, the player can only start after the streaming has already started; otherwise, it shuts down. Currently, a timer delays the start for 10 seconds. If the player does not start successfully, you can start it manually and connect to the HTTP stream URL.
